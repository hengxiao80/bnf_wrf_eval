    extrapolating outward from the mass-point (`XLONG`/`XLAT`) centers.

    WRF's Arakawa-C grid staggers U points in the west_east direction and
    V points in the south_north direction, each one point wider than the
    mass grid in that direction (confirmed against a real wrfout: mass
    (389, 549), U (389, 550), V (390, 549)) -- i.e. U/V points sit exactly
    on the west_east/south_north mass-cell edges. Both `point_lon`/
    `point_lat` and these U/V edges get projected through the *same*
    `proj` (matching WRF's own internal Lambert formula -- see
    `get_lambert_projection`) before any binning happens, so this is never
    comparing raw lat/lon against a rotated grid -- everything lives in one
    shared Lambert x/y plane.

    Reduces the full 2D projected U/V arrays to one representative row
    (for `x_edges`) and one representative column (for `y_edges`), on the
    assumption that they're separable -- checked empirically against a
    real wrfout: projected U-point x varies by at most ~3 m between the
    first and last row (out of a 2500 m cell), and projected V-point y by
    at most ~2 m between the first and last column, consistent with
    `XLONG_U`/`XLAT_V` being stored as float32 (~1 m precision at this
    magnitude) rather than any genuine non-uniformity -- i.e. WRF's grid
    really is regular in its own native projection, as expected by
    construction, and this reprojection preserves that to well under a
    MRMS pixel's size.
